... I could have died right then and there
But an angel pulled my hair
She said "Do all you dare" and
"You'll be just fine"
I've got my guardian angel working over-time
And they kept asking, "Is it true?"
"Did all of that really happen to you?"
A friend can save your life and a song can do so too
Michael saved me back in London,
One day, I'll be saving you!

I drink on the church steps like I'm some kind of saint
I recall all my past lives but last night is faint
But i couldn't have made it too far
Before running out of gas and stopping at some bar
If i could stay up every night of the week
I'd be dreaming the whole time, I'd never get enough sleep
I know someone's gonna lend me their light
With a soda and campari I feel like Mata Hari, in the night
I love the trouble, I'm a secret spy
I'm seeing double, got a secret life

No University degree, no need
In my Theory of Life
If you don't believe in magic, you'll only see the tragic
But then again, that's just a theory of mine

I swear, I know a thousand jokes
And i swear, my heart was never broke
I thought we'd stay together
They say nothing last forever
I'll find out if they're right
Go out and find my "nothing" for the night
The kinda nothing that'll make you believe
That every night is just like New Years Eve

Now you're like nothing in my life
Alright, in my Theory Of Life
