You fly like an arrow
I lie in the shadow
Only to be blessed with silence
You shoot using your licence to kill the pain

'Cos you fly an arrow
Straight to my heart
Blow it apart every time
You go like a dream
Nothing seems real
Don't even know how I feel

Now your shy
An I'm shallow,
My brain turns like a pulp of marrow,
But oh no, I'm not planning to stay lost
I know I could remove you from chaos

But you touch me with poison
Shoots to my brain
Sending me crazy, insane
Like some kind of marrow
Give you a taste of a feeling
A much brighter place

You fly like an arrow
I lie in the shadows
Only to be blessed with silence
You should use your licence to kill the pain

'Cos you fly an arrow
Straight to my heart
Blow it apart every time
Though I may dream
Nothing seems real
You don't even know how I feel
