Had to come correct, end of the summers when I come collect
Invite my people, if you're down then come around, connect
I'm from a land of different styles yet we coalesce
There ain't no fun, man y'all know the rest
Bet not test if you don't bring your own brew homie
Ladies only, still they include their own doughty
Blunt on a cool running, rum runneth over
Everyone going to hit their level were no longer sober

On a low-end theory, when the night is lukewarm
Main objective is to chill and turn the vibe up some more
Don't resist it if you feel it, you should like what you're on

Anywhere is a dancefloor, just find the tempo
Feel the instrumental while the lyrics fill your mental
Notice your cup low let me pour you more
Finna share with you something I've been sipping personally
Commence to burn tree, for the bonfire what you think
On the balcony we smoke weed
Eye contact, grown and acknowledged
Going to press on the issue before it's a problem
The ratio is even, so no reason to be single
She may want someone to leave with, Don't want to be lone
Enjoy the little time I'm out, but I rather be home
Massaging rubbing on your back on a private tone
Y'all be making me feel guilty that I'm trying to bone
With consent even them sometimes they don't condone
It's all good no force always natural
But me and shawty finna bounce, I'ma catch you though
